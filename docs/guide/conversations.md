# Conversations

Chatting with generative AI naturally involves the concept of chats or conversations. LocalChat gives you quite a few tools to manage your conversations.

You always need to create a conversation in order to be able to chat with a model. The conversation itself will store a bit of information as well.

## Creating a new conversation

To create a new conversation, simply click the "New conversation" button in the sidebar. This will create a new conversation with the currently loaded model, or, if no model is loaded, the first available model. This way, you can immediately begin chatting.

Each conversation in the sidebar will show you a few infos so that you know which is which.

In the first line, a conversation will display the model name with which you are conversing in it, as well as the date when you started the conversation. The following lines contain the description of the conversation (if there is one).

The last line will show you how many messages are part of this conversation, and, if you move your mouse cursor over a conversation, a few buttons with which you can modify the conversation.

## Changing the conversation model

To chat with a different model, use the dropdown at the top of the conversation. Note, however, that if you have a little bit of conversation with one model and then switch to another model, that other model may be confused if the previous model has a very different "style", so switching models mid-conversation may be fun, but could also produce unwanted behavior.

We recommend you only switch the model at the very beginning of a conversation.

> Note: If you start a conversation with one model but remove it later on, the conversation will automatically switch to the first available model when you activate it.

## Modifying conversations

When moving your mouse cursor over any conversation, a few additional buttons will appear on the conversation that let you do various things with it.

The editing icon allows you to adapt the description of the conversation. Give each conversation a description that allows you to find it again.

The trash bin icon allows you to remove conversations you no longer need. Be careful, as this step cannot be undone.
