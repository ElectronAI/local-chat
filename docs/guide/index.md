LocalChat is an application that allows you to run any generative AI model in the format of GGUF files ("GPT-Generated Unified Format"). The overall goal is to give you a dead-simple application that you can use to utilize generative AI in your day-to-day lives without having to think about anything technical.

Of course, the application allows you to customize various aspects of running these models to suit your needs.

In this guide, you will find everything you can adapt and how to tweak model parameters to deliver the optimal performance for you.
