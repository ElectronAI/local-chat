# Quick Start

This document outlines the workflow to get you from downloading the app to having your first successful conversation with a model, which involves only three simple steps.

> This guide is intended to get you up and running in only a few minutes, but will not go into any of the aspects in depth. Click on the various links to learn more about each component.

## Step One: Install the app

You install LocalChat as any other application on your computer. Download the correct installer (pay special attention if you are on Mac, because it is easy to mix up the Intel and Silicon-based installers), and install it appropriately.

If you have any questions or need specific help, refer to the [full setup guide](./setup).

## Step Two: Download a model

When you first start LocalChat, the main chat window will display a message that there are no models available. So you will first have to download and install a model. However, this process is effectively the same as downloading a Word document, except the file you will download is much bigger.

There are many different models out there with different capabilities. If you just want to try out the app, look at our [list of recommended models](./recommended-models) and pick the starter one, which is a good compromise between small size and capabilities. Later on you can download more models and quickly switch between them. We recommend having a look at our guide on [how to choose an appropriate model type](./choosing-a-model), since there are a few additional things to think about once you get deeper.

To download a model, the easiest method is to use LocalChat's built-in downloader. To do so, copy the link to the file to your clipboard, then open the model manager in LocalChat using the button in the statusbar, and paste the link. Then, click download, and close the model manager again. You can follow the download progress in the statusbar, which will also tell you the time remaining until the model is downloaded.

Alternatively, you can also just download the model from your web browser. Then, open the model manager, click "Open model folder", and drag the file into that folder.

Once the model file is in the model folder, open the model manager and click "Force reload model metadata" so that the app makes the model available.

Now you are ready to start your first conversation.

## Step Three: Chat!

With your first model set up, click on "New conversation" in the sidebar. This will load your model and open a fresh conversation for you. Type a message into the text area and click "Send", or press `Shift+Enter`. The model will immediately begin generating an answer. As soon as it begins generating words, you will see the message being written into the response field. Feel free to ask follow-up questions and have a chat with the model.

That's it! You have successfully set up LocalChat. Now you are ready to tweak the model settings, download specialized models for your needs, and adapt the experience to your liking. To do so, head back into the guide and read the rest of the documentation.
